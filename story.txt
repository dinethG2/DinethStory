This is a story about a man named Benjamin. Benjamin walked about two to three miles a day at around 6:00 am in the morning.
He felt that he was a very successful person. Then one day he woke up at 6:00 pm on a friday. He wasn't affected by this whatsoever
and walked 5 miles that day.

Then next week Benjamin had an inspirational thought. What if he ran 3 miles instead of walking 3 miles? He could burn twice the calories!Benjamin woke up that Monday feeling super pumped, and he set off on the first mile.
