This is a story about a man named Benjamin. Benjamin walked about two to three miles a day at around 6:00 am in the morning.
He felt that he was a very successful person. Then one day he woke up at 6:00 pm on a friday. He wasn't affected by this whatsoever
and walked 5 miles that day.

Then next week Benjamin had an inspirational thought. What if he ran 3 miles instead of walking 3 miles? He could burn twice the calories!Benjamin woke up that Monday feeling super pumped, and he set off on the first mile.

Benjamin was running through the 608 with his woes. He was feeling so energzied and he was was up all night playing Frogger so he was dodging traffic and
carelessly running on the street. Eventually he came up on the intersection right by Ian's pizza. Coming around the corner was Benjamin's cousin Benny in the whip
Benny was hitting the nastiest drift you seen in yo life. It was like the final race in Tokyo Drift. Benjamin went right over the hood of his car. It was the nastiest
collision I seen in my life, I was recording the whole thing on my Snapchat inside Ian's while yelling Worldstar.

Getting up and dusting himself off, Benjamin decided maybe running wasn't for him. The next day, he decided to take up walking once more. However, this time, he decided to walk 500 miles. Surprisingly, he did it without even breaking a sweat. So, right then and there, he decided to walk 500 more.

After walking those 1,000 miles, Benjamin fell at someone's door. That next day, Benjamin woke up and checked his phone. He saw countless videos of himself on the internet getting hit by a car while running and then walking 1,000 miles. Benjamin became a viral sensation! Later that week he was invited to Ellen's show to talk about his experience. From then on, Benjamin became a meme for the rest of his life, but he still felt very successful and walked 5 miles everyday.
